# VeeamNotify

Send Veeam Backup & Replication session summary notifications to Discord, Microsoft Teams, and Slack, detailing session result and statistics and optionally alerting you via mention when a job finishes in a warning or failed state.

VeeamNotify is a replacement for [VeeamDiscordNotifications](https://github.com/tigattack/VeeamDiscordNotifications) and the respective [Teams](https://github.com/tigattack/VeeamTeamsNotifications) and [Slack](https://github.com/tigattack/VeeamSlackNotifications) projects, featuring improvements across the board and support for all the aforementioned messaging services in one, easy to use project.

### *Agent job support

Due to limitations in Veeam, only some types of Agent jobs are supported.

**Supported** jobs are known as "Agent Backup" or "Managed by backup server". **Unsupported** jobs are known as "Agent policy" or "Managed by agent". See the spoilered illustration below if this isn't clear to you.

**Note:** Linux Agent Backup jobs are also supported, this image is only an example.
</details>

You can read about the difference between these two Agent job types [here](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/agents/agent_job_protection_mode.html?ver=110#selecting-job-mode).

Unfortunately, even supported Agent jobs return a reduced amount of session information, so you won't see as much detail in the notification (see the example screenshots at the top).  
As much relevant information as I've been able to discover from such backup sessions is included in the notifications, but I welcome any suggestions for improvement in this area.
